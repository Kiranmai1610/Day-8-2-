    JavaScript language overview JavaScript is a multi-paradigm, dynamic
    language with types and operators, standard built-in objects, and methods.
    Its syntax is based on the Java and C languages — many structures from those
    languages apply to JavaScript as well. JavaScript supports object-oriented
    programming with object prototypes and classes. It also supports functional
    programming since functions are first-class objects that can be easily
    created via expressions and passed around like any other object. This page
    serves as a quick overview of various JavaScript language features, written
    for readers with background in other languages, such as C or Java. Data
    types Let's start off by looking at the building blocks of any language: the
    types. JavaScript programs manipulate values, and those values all belong to
    a type. JavaScript offers seven primitive types: Number: used for all number
    values (integer and floating point) except for very big integers. BigInt:
    used for arbitrarily large integers. String: used to store text. Boolean:
    true and false — usually used for conditional logic. Symbol: used for
    creating unique identifiers that won't collide. Undefined: indicating that a
    variable has not been assigned a value. Null: indicating a deliberate
    non-value. Everything else is known as an Object. Common object types
    include: Function Array Date RegExp Error Functions aren't special data
    structures in JavaScript — they are just a special type of object that can
    be called. Numbers JavaScript has two built-in numeric types: Number and
    BigInt. The Number type is a IEEE 754 64-bit double-precision floating point
    value, which means integers can be safely represented between -(253 − 1) and
    253 − 1 without loss of precision, and floating point numbers can be stored
    all the way up to 1.79 × 10308. Within numbers, JavaScript does not
    distinguish between floating point numbers and integers. js Copy to
    Clipboard console.log(3 / 2); // 1.5, not 1 So an apparent integer is in
    fact implicitly a float. Because of IEEE 754 encoding, sometimes floating
    point arithmetic can be imprecise. js Copy to Clipboard console.log(0.1 +
    0.2); // 0.30000000000000004 For operations that expect integers, such as
    bitwise operations, the number will be converted to a 32-bit integer. Number
    literals can also have prefixes to indicate the base (binary, octal,
    decimal, or hexadecimal), or an exponent suffix. js Copy to Clipboard
    console.log(0b111110111); // 503 console.log(0o767); // 503
    console.log(0x1f7); // 503 console.log(5.03e2); // 503 The BigInt type is an
    arbitrary length integer. Its behavior is similar to C's integer types (e.g.
    division truncates to zero), except it can grow indefinitely. BigInts are
    specified with a number literal and an n suffix. js Copy to Clipboard
    console.log(-3n / 2n); // -1n The standard arithmetic operators are
    supported, including addition, subtraction, remainder arithmetic, etc.
    BigInts and numbers cannot be mixed in arithmetic operations. The Math
    object provides standard mathematical functions and constants. js Copy to
    Clipboard Math.sin(3.5); const circumference = 2 * Math.PI * r; There are
    three ways to convert a string to a number: parseInt(), which parses the
    string for an integer. parseFloat(), which parses the string for a
    floating-point number. The Number() function, which parses a string as if
    it's a number literal and supports many different number representations.
    You can also use the unary plus + as a shorthand for Number(). Number values
    also include NaN (short for "Not a Number") and Infinity. Many "invalid
    math" operations will return NaN — for example, if attempting to parse a
    non-numeric string, or using Math.log() on a negative value. Division by
    zero produces Infinity (positive or negative). NaN is contagious: if you
    provide it as an operand to any mathematical operation, the result will also
    be NaN. NaN is the only value in JavaScript that's not equal to itself (per
    IEEE 754 specification). Strings Strings in JavaScript are sequences of
    Unicode characters. This should be welcome news to anyone who has had to
    deal with internationalization. More accurately, they are UTF-16 encoded. js
    Copy to Clipboard console.log("Hello, world"); console.log("你好，世界！");
    // Nearly all Unicode characters can be written literally in string literals
    Strings can be written with either single or double quotes — JavaScript does
    not have the distinction between characters and strings. If you want to
    represent a single character, you just use a string consisting of that
    single character. js Copy to Clipboard console.log("Hello"[1] === "e"); //
    true To find the length of a string (in code units), access its length
    property. Strings have utility methods to manipulate the string and access
    information about the string. Because all primitives are immutable by
    design, these methods return new strings. The + operator is overloaded for
    strings: when one of the operands is a string, it performs string
    concatenation instead of number addition. A special template literal syntax
    allows you to write strings with embedded expressions more succinctly.
    Unlike Python's f-strings or C#'s interpolated strings, template literals
    use backticks (not single or double quotes). js Copy to Clipboard const age
    = 25; console.log("I am " + age + " years old."); // String concatenation
    console.log(`I am ${age} years old.`); // Template literal Other types
    JavaScript distinguishes between null, which indicates a deliberate
    non-value (and is only accessible through the null keyword), and undefined,
    which indicates absence of value. There are many ways to obtain undefined: A
    return statement with no value (return;) implicitly returns undefined.
    Accessing a nonexistent object property (obj.iDontExist) returns undefined.
    A variable declaration without initialization (let x;) will implicitly
    initialize the variable to undefined. JavaScript has a Boolean type, with
    possible values true and false — both of which are keywords. Any value can
    be converted to a boolean according to the following rules: false, 0, empty
    strings (""), NaN, null, and undefined all become false. All other values
    become true. You can perform this conversion explicitly using the Boolean()
    function: js Copy to Clipboard Boolean(""); // false Boolean(234); // true
    However, this is rarely necessary, as JavaScript will silently perform this
    conversion when it expects a boolean, such as in an if statement (see
    Control structures). For this reason, we sometimes speak of "truthy" and
    "falsy", meaning values that become true and false, respectively, when used
    in boolean contexts. Boolean operations such as && (logical and), ||
    (logical or), and ! (logical not) are supported; see Operators. The Symbol
    type is often used to create unique identifiers. Every symbol created with
    the Symbol() function is guaranteed to be unique. In addition, there are
    registered symbols, which are shared constants, and well-known symbols,
    which are utilized by the language as "protocols" for certain operations.
    You can read more about them in the symbol reference. Variables Variables in
    JavaScript are declared using one of three keywords: let, const, or var. let
    allows you to declare block-level variables. The declared variable is
    available from the block it is enclosed in.
