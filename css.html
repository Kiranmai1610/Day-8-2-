    <p><b>CSS: Cascading Style Sheets Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</b></p>
    CSS is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document
    written in HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or
    XHTML). CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper,
    in speech, or on other media. CSS is among the core languages of the open
    web and is standardized across Web browsers according to W3C specifications.
    Previously, the development of various parts of CSS specification was done
    synchronously, which allowed the versioning of the latest recommendations.
    You might have heard about CSS1, CSS2.1, or even CSS3. There will never be a
    CSS3 or a CSS4; rather, everything is now just "CSS" with individual CSS
    modules having version numbers. After CSS 2.1, the scope of the
    specification increased significantly and the progress on different CSS
    modules started to differ so much, that it became more effective to develop
    and release recommendations separately per module. Instead of versioning the
    CSS specification, W3C now periodically takes a snapshot of the latest
    stable state of the CSS specification and individual modules progress. CSS
    modules now have version numbers, or levels, such as CSS Color Module Level
    5. Key resources CSS Introduction If you're new to web development, be sure
    to read our CSS basics article to learn what CSS is and how to use it. CSS
    Tutorials Our CSS learning area contains a wealth of tutorials to take you
    from beginner level to proficiency, covering all the fundamentals. CSS
    Reference Our CSS reference describes every property and concept of CSS.
    Tutorials Our CSS Learning Area features multiple modules that teach CSS
    from the ground up — no previous knowledge required. CSS first steps CSS
    (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and layout web pages — for
    example, to alter the font, color, size, and spacing of your content, split
    it into multiple columns, or add animations and other decorative features.
    This module provides a gentle beginning to your path towards CSS mastery
    with the basics of how it works, what the syntax looks like, and how you can
    start using it to add styling to HTML. CSS building blocks This module
    carries on where CSS first steps left off — now you've gained familiarity
    with the language and its syntax, and got some basic experience with using
    it, it's time to dive a bit deeper. This module looks at the cascade and
    inheritance, all the selector types we have available, units, sizing,
    styling backgrounds and borders, debugging, and lots more. The aim here is
    to provide you with a toolkit for writing competent CSS and help you
    understand all the essential theory, before moving on to more specific
    disciplines like text styling and CSS layout. CSS styling text With the
    basics of the CSS language covered, the next CSS topic for you to
    concentrate on is styling text — one of the most common things you'll do
    with CSS. Here we look at text styling fundamentals, including setting font,
    boldness, italics, line and letter spacing, drop shadows, and other text
    features. We round off the module by looking at applying custom fonts to
    your page, and styling lists and links. CSS layout At this point we've
    already looked at CSS fundamentals, how to style text, and how to style and
    manipulate the boxes that your content sits inside. Now it's time to look at
    how to place your boxes in the right place in relation to the viewport, and
    to each other. We have covered the necessary prerequisites so we can now
    dive deep into CSS layout, looking at different display settings, modern
    layout tools like flexbox, CSS grid, and positioning, and some of the legacy
    techniques you might still want to know about. Use CSS to solve common
    problems This module provides links to sections of content explaining how to
    use CSS to solve common problems when creating a web page.
